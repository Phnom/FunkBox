A Step Sequencer built with React & Tone JS. 

4 channels: "Kick", "Hihat", "Noise", "Poly".
Every channel contains 8 buttons and every button represents 1/8 note in a bar.
Every channel controls a Tone sound module.
Every button can set a different rhytmic pattern for that part of a sequence with or without 1/16 triplets and pauses.

next update I will:
Illustrate the generated rhytmic pattern with canvas. 
Change Sound/Samples feature.
Effects for channels and masterbus.

npm install
npm start
